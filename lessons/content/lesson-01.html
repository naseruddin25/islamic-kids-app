  <h3>Why Intention Matters</h3>
  <p>
    The Prophet ﷺ taught us something really important: what you do only counts based on why you do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If someone does something for Allah—because they truly want to please Him—then that action is for Allah. But if someone does the same action for attention, status, or personal gain, then that’s all they get out of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, many great scholars of Islam started their books with this teaching. It reminds us that before focusing on what we do, we need to focus on why we do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scholars explained that this teaching is completely authentic and accepted by everyone. One famous scholar even placed it at the very beginning of his book to send a clear message: if an action isn’t done sincerely for Allah, it has no real value—now or later.
  </p>
  <p>
    So whether you’re learning about Islam, praying, fasting, or doing any good deed, check your intention first. Make sure you’re doing it for Allah alone, not to impress people or follow trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    When your intention is sincere, even small actions become meaningful—and Allah promises a great reward for those who are sincere.

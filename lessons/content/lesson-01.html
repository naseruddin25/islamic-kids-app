    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; color: var(--color-primary, #ffd166);">Lesson 1 – Intentions: Why You Do What You Do</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Before you pray, help someone, or make a decision, something important happens inside your heart: your intention. In Islam, intention matters more than most people realize. The same action can be rewarded—or not rewarded at all—based on why it was done.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">An intention is the reason behind your action. It answers a simple question: Who am I doing this for? Are you doing it for Allah, or because people are watching? Are you doing it for praise, approval, or acceptance, or simply out of habit? Two people can do the exact same thing, but with Allah, those actions can be completely different.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught us that actions are judged by intentions. That means Allah looks at your heart first, before He looks at your actions. You could pray perfectly on the outside, but if your heart is focused on people instead of Allah, that prayer loses its value. A small good deed done quietly, with sincerity, can be rewarded greatly because the intention was sincere.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">A simple habit can change everything. Before you do something important, pause for one second and check your heart. Ask yourself: Am I doing this because Allah commanded it? Am I doing this for Allah’s pleasure? Or am I doing this to be noticed by people? That one-second pause can turn an ordinary action into an act of worship.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Intentions are not just for prayer—they apply to your everyday life. When you study, you can intend to gain knowledge and use it in a good and honest way. When you help your parents, you can intend to please Allah by being respectful and responsible. When you work hard, you can intend to support yourself and others in a halal way. Even when you rest, you can intend to recharge so you can be better tomorrow. In Islam, everyday life can become worship if your intention is right.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Imagine two people giving charity. They give the same amount and look the same on the outside. One gives to be praised, and the other gives quietly for Allah alone. To people they look identical, but to Allah they are completely different—because Allah knows what is in the heart, even when no one else does.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0;">As you go through your day, remember this: before your actions, check your heart. Before your words, check your intention. And before anything important, pause and ask yourself: Who am I doing this for? If the answer is Allah, then even the smallest action can become something great.</p>

      <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.05em;">The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:</p>
      <p style="margin: 12px 0 0 0; font-weight: 600; color: var(--color-text, #2c2c2c);">
        "Actions are only judged by intentions, and each person will get what they intended.<br>
        So whoever migrated for Allah and His Messenger, then his migration was for Allah and His Messenger.<br>
        And whoever migrated for something worldly, or to marry a woman, then his migration was for what he migrated for."

      <p style="margin: 16px 0 0 0; line-height: 1.7;">This shows us that Islam is not just about doing actions. It is about worshipping Allah alone, sincerely, and in the way He taught us.</p>

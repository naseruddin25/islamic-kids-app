      <div class="topic-section" id="faith-doubt">
        <h2>💭 Faith & Doubt</h2>
        <p>
          Doubt isn't the opposite of faith — it's part of the journey. Every Muslim at some point wonders: Is this real? Why do I have to believe? What if I have questions?
        </p>
        <p>
          Islam doesn't ask you to ignore your brain. The Qur'an constantly says "Do they not think?" and "Do they not reflect?" Questions are normal. What matters is that you seek honest answers and don't let doubt paralyze you.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What questions about faith do I have right now?</li>
          <li>Am I willing to seek knowledge from trusted sources, or am I letting doubts sit unanswered?</li>
          <li>Do I understand the difference between honest questioning and stubbornness?</li>
          <li>Have I talked to someone knowledgeable about my doubts?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- FRIENDS & PRESSURE -->
      <div class="topic-section" id="friends-pressure">
        <h2>👥 Friends & Pressure</h2>
        <p>
          Your friends shape you. The Prophet ﷺ said a good friend is like a perfume seller — even if you don't buy anything, you'll smell nice. A bad friend is like a blacksmith — even if you don't get burned, you'll get smoke on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peer pressure is real. Sometimes it's obvious (being pushed to do something haram), and sometimes it's subtle (feeling like you have to hide who you are to fit in). Islam teaches you to be confident in your identity and choose friends who lift you up, not drag you down.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do my friends encourage me to be a better person, or do they pull me away from what I know is right?</li>
          <li>Am I willing to stand alone if that's what it takes to stay true to my values?</li>
          <li>Have I ever felt pressured to do something I knew was wrong? How did I handle it?</li>
          <li>Do I surround myself with people who remind me of Allah, or people who make me forget?</li>
          <li>Am I being a good influence on my friends?</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA & IDENTITY -->
      <div class="topic-section" id="social-media">
        <h2>📱 Social Media & Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Social media can be a tool or a trap. It can connect you with knowledge and good people, or it can waste your time and distort your sense of self. The issue isn't the platform — it's how you use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Islam teaches you that your worth comes from Allah, not from likes, followers, or comments. When you base your identity on what other people think, you lose yourself. When you base it on your relationship with Allah, you stay grounded no matter what.
        </p>
        <a href="lessons/" class="topic-link">Start with: Short Lessons on Intention & Purpose</a>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How much time do I spend on social media daily? Is it helping or hurting me?</li>
          <li>Do I post or scroll to seek validation, or to genuinely connect and learn?</li>
          <li>Am I comparing my real life to other people's highlight reels?</li>
          <li>Do I feel anxious or inadequate after scrolling? What does that tell me?</li>
          <li>Can I take a full day off from social media without feeling FOMO?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- ANGER, ANXIETY, & EMOTIONS -->
      <div class="topic-section" id="anger-anxiety">
        <h2>😤 Anger, Anxiety, & Emotions</h2>
        <p>
          The Prophet ﷺ said, "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle — it's the one who controls themselves when they're angry." Controlling your emotions doesn't mean suppressing them. It means managing them in a way that doesn't hurt you or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anxiety and anger are normal. Life is stressful. But Islam gives you tools: prayer (especially when you're overwhelmed), remembrance of Allah, seeking knowledge, trusting in His plan, and talking to people you trust. You're not supposed to carry everything alone.
        </p>
        <a href="lessons/" class="topic-link">Start with: Short Lessons on Worship & Character</a>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What triggers my anger or anxiety the most?</li>
          <li>Do I turn to Allah when I'm upset, or do I turn away?</li>
          <li>Have I learned healthy ways to process my emotions (journaling, exercise, talking to someone)?</li>
          <li>Do I know when to ask for help, or do I bottle things up?</li>
          <li>Am I patient with myself when I make mistakes?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- SCHOOL & DISCIPLINE -->
      <div class="topic-section" id="school-discipline">
        <h2>📚 School & Discipline</h2>
        <p>
          Islam values knowledge. The first word revealed in the Qur'an was "Read." Education isn't just about getting good grades — it's about developing your mind, learning to think critically, and preparing yourself to contribute to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discipline isn't punishment. It's training yourself to do what needs to be done, even when you don't feel like it. Whether it's studying, praying on time, or keeping your commitments, discipline is what separates those who talk about goals from those who achieve them.
        </p>
        <a href="lessons/" class="topic-link">Start with: Short Lessons on Purpose & Intention</a>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Am I doing my best in school, or just enough to get by?</li>
          <li>Do I see education as a way to serve Allah and help people, or just as something I have to do?</li>
          <li>What distractions keep me from being disciplined (phone, procrastination, laziness)?</li>
          <li>Do I manage my time well, or do I always feel rushed?</li>
          <li>Can I stick to a routine for 7 days straight?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- INTENTIONS & SINCERITY -->
      <div class="topic-section" id="intentions">
        <h2>🎯 Intentions & Sincerity</h2>
        <p>
          The Prophet ﷺ said, "Actions are judged by intentions." You can do something good and get no reward if your intention is to show off. And you can do something small and get immense reward if your intention is purely for Allah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerity (ikhlas) is doing things for Allah alone — not for praise, not for recognition, not even for feeling good about yourself. It's the hardest thing to achieve and the most valuable. Check your intentions constantly, because they shift without you realizing.
        </p>
        <a href="lessons/" class="topic-link">Start with: Short Lessons on Intention & Worship</a>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 24px; font-size: 1.125rem;">Reflect on these:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When I do something good, am I doing it for Allah or for people to notice?</li>
          <li>Do I feel disappointed when my good deeds go unnoticed?</li>
          <li>Can I do an act of worship in secret without telling anyone?</li>
          <li>Do I renew my intention before I pray, or do I just go through the motions?</li>
          <li>What motivates me — Allah's pleasure or people's approval?</li>
